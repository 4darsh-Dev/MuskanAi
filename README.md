## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

- **Front End:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
- **Digital Assitant** Python(pyttsx3,Nltk,PyTorch,pandas,numpy,scikit-learn,transformers)
- **Backend and API:** Django and REST Framework
- **Deep Learning LLM** Hugging Face API

## Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

### Approach
1. **Dataset Collection**:
   - Gather publicly available datasets from sources like Kaggle, Hugging Face, and other repositories.
   - Create custom-labelled datasets from movie dialogues, social media conversations, video transcripts, and CC content to train the models for specific tasks.

2. **Model Fine-Tuning**:
   - Fine-tune llama2-7b and BERT models using the collected datasets for sentiment analysis, question answering, and NER tasks.
   - Implement transfer learning techniques to adapt the models to various contexts and domains.

3. **Contextual Understanding**:
   - Utilize Q/A datasets containing contextual information with emotional annotations to enhance the models' understanding of emotional context.
   - Incorporate ontologies to interpret cultural contexts and social relationships influencing emotional expression.

4. **Reinforcement Learning**:
   - Implement a reinforcement learning mechanism based on user feedback (positive/negative ratings) to continually improve the models' performance in generating responses.

### Workflow
Our workflow follows a sequential process:
1. **User Input**: Users provide input queries or statements.
2. **Intent Recognition**: Determine the intent behind the user input.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment of the input.
4. **Response Generation**: Generate appropriate responses based on the input and sentiment analysis.

### Milestones
- **Milestone 1**: Dataset Collection and Preprocessing
- **Milestone 2**: Model Fine-Tuning for Sentiment Analysis
- **Milestone 3**: Model Fine-Tuning for Question Answering
- **Milestone 4**: Model Fine-Tuning for Named Entity Recognition
- **Milestone 5**: Integration of Reinforcement Learning Mechanism
- **Milestone 6**: Testing and Evaluation
- **Milestone 7**: Documentation and Finalization

## Project Setup Locally üöÄ

### Setting up Django API

1. clone the git repository locally.
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/4darsh-Dev/MuskanAi.git
```
2. Install python and setup virtual envionment. 
#### 1. Open terminal in MuskanAi folder
```bash 
pip install virtualenv 
```
```bash 
cd MuskanAi
```
```bash 
python -m venv myenv 
```
#### Activating virtual environment named as myenv
##### 1. In Windows ü™ü
```bash 
.\myenv\Scripts\activate  
```
##### 2. In Linux/Mac üêß
```bash
 source myenv/bin/activate
 ```

3. Installing required modules and libraries
```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt 
 ```

4. Running Django Development Server
```bash 
python manage.py makemigrations 
```
```bash 
python manage.py migrate 
```
```bash 
python manage.py runserver 
```
-- Server will be started at localhost (example: http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
